0.9.1 (2016-10-21)
------------------
* add full VERSIONs / SONAMEs to all libraries (`#273 <https://github.com/ros-planning/moveit/issues/273>`_)
  * add full VERSIONs / SONAMEs to all core libraries
  As a result the libraries do not install as `libmoveit_xyz.so` anymore,
  but as `libmoveit_xyz.so.${MOVEIT_VERSION}` and only provide `libmoveit_xyz.so`
  as a symlink pointing to the versioned file.
  Because this sets each library's SONAME to the *full version*, this enforces
  that *every* binary links with the versioned library file from now on and
  has to be relinked with *each* new release of MoveIt!.
  The alternative would be to set the SONAME to `$MAJOR.$MINOR` and ignore the patch version,
  but because we currently stay with one `$MAJOR.$MINOR` number within each ROS distribution,
  we had (and likely will have) ABI changes in the `$PATCH` version releases too.
  The reason for this commit is that it is practically impossible to maintain full ABI compatibility
  within each ROS distribution and still add the the features/patches the community asks for.
  This has resulted in more than one ABI-incompatible MoveIt! release in the recent past
  within a ROS distribution. Because the libraries have not been versioned up to now,
  there was no way to indicate the incompatible changes and users who did not rebuild
  their whole workspace with the new release encountered weird and hard-to-track segfaults
  or broken behavior.
  * add SONAMES to all non-core libraries too
* Version down and consolidattion once again; having an issue with catkin_prepare_release to bump all packages (asked at http://answers.ros.org/question/245969/catkin_prepare_release-not-bumping-packages-in-a-certain-folder).
* 0.9.0
* More version consolidattion for all package.xml in the moveit repo (addition to https://github.com/ros-planning/moveit/commit/4d66734926dc62eec9e0d5bbcab7c3e918dfed46. Seems like catkin_prepare_release requires all packages to be in equal version).
* Replace broken Eigen3 with correctly spelled EIGEN3 (`#254 <https://github.com/ros-planning/moveit/issues/254>`_)
  * Fix Eigen3 dependency throughout packages
  * Eigen 3.2 does not provide EIGEN3_INCLUDE_DIRS, only EIGEN3_INCLUDE_DIR
* Use shared_ptr typedefs in collision_distance_field and chomp.
* Fix CHOMP planner and CollisionDistanceField (`#155 <https://github.com/ros-planning/moveit/issues/155>`_)
  * Copy collision_distance_field package
  * Resurrect chomp
  * remove some old Makefiles and manifests
